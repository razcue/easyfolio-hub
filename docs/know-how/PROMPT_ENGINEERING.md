## 1. **What is prompt engineering?**

**Prompt engineering** is the process of designing and refining the text, instructions, or input ("prompt") given to AI models (like ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.) to achieve desired results.  
It involves:
- Crafting clear, effective prompts to guide model behavior.
- Experimenting with wording, structure, and context.
- Testing and iterating to improve accuracy, reliability, and relevance of outputs.

**Example:**  
Instead of asking “Tell me about cats,” you might engineer a prompt:  
“Write a concise summary about the behavioral traits of domestic cats for a children’s book.”

## 2. **What is prompt management and monitoring?**

**Prompt management** refers to organizing, versioning, storing, and collaborating on prompts outside the codebase, often in dedicated tools or platforms.

**Prompt monitoring** means tracking how prompts perform in production, analyzing their effectiveness, and making adjustments based on feedback, metrics, or outcomes.

**Why?**
- AI prompts can have a big impact on product quality.
- Managing them centrally allows for collaboration, audit trails, and updates without needing code changes.
- Monitoring ensures prompts continue to deliver the desired results as data or requirements change.

---

## 3. **What does [promptground.io](https://www.promptground.io/) offer?**

**PromptGround** is a platform for prompt management and collaboration.  
It offers:

## 5. **Explaining: “I'm non-technical but use AI daily. Being able to impact production prompts is a blessing. I have template prompts with variables that work like forms - it's perfect for my workflow.”**

**Translation:**
- The speaker isn’t a programmer, but uses AI in their work.
- PromptGround lets them change prompts that affect live AI systems (production) without coding.
- They use “template prompts” with fillable variables, like forms, making it easy to customize output for different needs.
- This workflow is user-friendly and empowering for non-technical staff.

---

**Summary:**  
Prompt engineering is designing AI inputs for best results.  
Prompt management/monitoring is organizing and tracking those prompts for quality and collaboration.  
PromptGround provides tools to do this outside the codebase, enabling both technical and non-technical team members to work together efficiently and safely.

---

## **What does “prompts in production” mean?**

**Production** is the environment where your app runs for real users—not just for testing or development.

A **prompt** is the text or instructions you give to an AI model (like GPT-4) to get the desired output.

So, **“prompts in production”** means:
- The prompts your app actually sends to the AI when real users use the app.
- These prompts directly affect what the AI returns to users in the live/real app.

---

## **How do prompts impact the production app and code base?**

- In traditional software, if you want to change what an app does, you have to modify the code and redeploy it.
- In AI-powered apps, *prompts* can control a lot of the logic and output.
- If your prompts are embedded in your code, changing them usually requires a code change and redeploy.

**But:**  
If you use a tool (like PromptGround) to manage prompts *outside* your codebase:
- You can update prompts without touching the code.
- Non-technical team members can change how the AI responds just by editing the prompt.
- These changes go “live” in production as soon as the prompt is updated.

---

## **What does “deploy prompts” mean?**

- Traditionally, **deploying** means updating the code and pushing it to production.
- With prompt management platforms, **deploying a prompt** means updating the prompt so the live app uses the new version.
- You don’t need to redeploy the whole app—you just update the prompt, and the app fetches the latest prompt from the platform.

---

## **What does “prompts that affect production without coding” mean?**

- You can make changes to the prompts that directly affect what users see and how the AI behaves.
- You do this without writing or changing code, just by editing the prompt in the management tool.
- For example, you could change the instructions for how the AI answers a customer support question, and instantly see the change in the live app.

---

## **Why is this important?**

- **Speed:** You can make updates instantly, without waiting for engineers to change code.
- **Collaboration:** Non-technical team members (like writers, marketers, or support staff) can improve the AI’s responses.
- **Safety:** Prompts are versioned and managed, so you can roll back if needed.
- **Flexibility:** The logic and behavior of AI features can be updated independently of the codebase.

## **How Prompt Management Works in AI-powered Apps**

### **1. SaaS Example: Customer Support Chatbot**

**Conventional App:**
- Logic for responding to support questions is coded in JavaScript/PHP/Python.
- Changing what the bot says requires developers to change code and redeploy.

**AI-powered App:**
- The bot uses an LLM (like GPT-4) and prompts to generate answers.
- The prompt might be:  
  _“You are a helpful support agent for Acme SaaS. When a user asks about billing, answer using our official billing policy below: {policy_text}”_

**Prompt Management:**
- The support manager updates the prompt to reflect a new billing policy, without touching code.
- The change goes live instantly; the bot’s answers reflect the new policy.

---

### **2. E-commerce Store: AI Product Recommendations**

**Conventional App:**
- Recommendation logic is coded with algorithms/rules.
- Any update requires code changes.

**AI-powered App:**
- The store uses an AI model and a prompt like:  
  _“Based on the following purchase history, suggest 3 products the user will love. Focus on seasonal items.”_

**Prompt Management:**
- The marketing team decides to emphasize “sale items” in recommendations.
- They edit the prompt:  
  _“... Focus on seasonal and sale items.”_
- Instantly, the AI recommends more sale products—no developer needed.

---

### **3. Business Workflow: Automated Email Generation**

**Conventional App:**
- Email templates are coded or stored in files.
- Changes require a developer to update templates.

**AI-powered App:**
- Emails are generated by an LLM using prompts:  
  _“Write a polite follow-up email to a customer who didn’t respond in 7 days.”_

**Prompt Management:**
- The sales manager updates the prompt to add a discount offer.
- The new prompt:  
  _“... Include a 10% discount offer for orders placed this month.”_
- The change is live immediately, affecting all outgoing emails.

---

## **Why is This Powerful?**

- **Non-developers can change app behavior** (how the AI responds or generates text) by editing prompts.
- **No code changes or redeploys needed.**
- **Faster adaptation** to business needs, regulations, or marketing strategies.

Excellent question! Let’s break down the architecture and flow of **AI-powered apps** that can search/edit databases, run scripts, or call APIs, and clarify the role of prompts and business logic.

---

## **How AI-Powered Apps Enable AI to Act on Data, Scripts, and APIs**

### **1. Typical AI-powered App Architecture**

Here's the high-level structure:

```
[User] → [Frontend (web/app)] → [Backend server] → [AI Model/API] → [Business Logic (codebase)] → [External Resources: Database/API/scripts]
```

- **User** interacts with the app via frontend (browser, app, etc.).
- **Frontend** collects user input and sends it to the backend.
- **Backend** processes the input and, if needed, interacts with an AI model (like GPT-4, Claude, etc.).
- **AI Model** receives a prompt (instructions, context, etc.), generates output.
- **Business Logic** interprets the AI output and takes action (query database, call API, run script).

---

### **2. How Prompts and Logic Work Together**

**Prompts:**
- The app sends a prompt to the AI model: e.g., _“Find all customers who bought product X last month.”_
- The prompt can include instructions and context.

**AI Output:**
- The AI might return a **database query**, an **API call definition**, or even a **script**.

**Business Logic:**
- The app **parses the AI’s response** and decides what to do.
- If the AI output is a database query, the app runs it (after validation/safety checks).
- If the output defines an API call, the app executes it.
- If the output is a script, the app might run it in a secure sandbox.

---

### **3. Example Flow: AI-assisted Database Search in SaaS**

1. **User Input:**  
   _“Show me all invoices over $1,000 in July.”_

2. **App Logic:**
  - App sends a prompt to the AI:  
    _“Generate a SQL query to find invoices over $1,000 in July from the invoices table.”_
  - AI returns:  
    `SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE amount > 1000 AND date >= '2025-07-01' AND date <= '2025-07-31';`
  - App validates the query for safety.
  - App executes the query and returns results to the user.

---

### **4. Example Flow: AI Calling External API**

1. **User Input:**  
   _“Get the weather for Barcelona.”_

2. **App Logic:**
  - App sends prompt:  
    _“Generate an API request to OpenWeatherMap for Barcelona’s current weather.”_
  - AI returns API call definition (endpoint, parameters).
  - App builds the API request and fetches data.

---

### **5. Where Are Prompts Managed?**

- Prompts can be stored **outside the codebase** (in platforms like PromptGround, a database, config files, etc.), allowing non-devs to update them.
- The **codebase** defines how to use the AI output (run query, call API, etc.) but the prompts themselves can be edited externally.

---

## **Security and Safety Considerations**

- **Validation:** Always validate AI-generated queries/scripts before running them (to prevent security risks).
- **Permissioning:** Control what the AI can access (databases, APIs, scripts) via app logic.
- **Monitoring:** Track AI actions in production for safety and compliance.

---

```

---

## **In Short:**
- Prompts guide the AI.
- Business logic uses AI output to interact with data/APIs/scripts.
- Prompts can be managed outside the codebase.
- The codebase orchestrates secure, validated actions based on AI suggestions.

---

Great use case! You want to add AI features (like text refinement or summarization) to your **easyfolio hub** project, similar to LinkedIn’s “Make text clearer” button, but **with no backend**—meaning you need a third-party API that you can call directly from your frontend.

Let’s walk through **possible zero-cost/free solutions**, how to integrate them, and what you need to know.

---

## 1. **Free AI Text APIs You Can Use From the Frontend**

### **A. OpenRouter (openrouter.ai)**
- Offers API endpoints for multiple open AI models (some free).
- You can use their API to send a prompt and get a response.
- [Docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs)
- **Caveat:** Requires an API key (free tier available, some models are free).

### **B. Gemini from Google (makersuite.google.com)**
- Gemini API is available with a free quota.
- You can call it from the frontend (though best practice is via a proxy/backend for security).

### **C. Hugging Face Inference API**
- Hugging Face offers hosted models, some with free tiers.
- You can use [Hugging Face Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/inference-api) for text tasks.

### **D. Replicate.com**
- Hosts many open-source models with free (limited) usage.
- Provides HTTP endpoints.

### **E. OpenAI Playground & API**
- GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have a cost, but sometimes there’s a free trial.
- Not truly “zero-cost” for production, but worth mentioning for experimentation.

### **F. NLPCloud.io**
- Offers free tier for hosted open models.

### **G. DeepInfra**
- Free access to open-source models via API.

---

## 2. **Example: Integrate with Hugging Face Inference API (Free Tier)**

### **Step 1: Pick a Model**
- For text improvement, use a summarization or paraphrasing model.
- Example: `facebook/bart-large-cnn` (summarization)

### **Step 2: API Call From Frontend**

Here’s a simple fetch example in JavaScript:

```javascript
async function improveText(inputText) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/bart-large-cnn', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_HF_TOKEN', // Some models work without a token
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({inputs: inputText})
  });
  const result = await response.json();
  return result[0]?.summary_text || inputText;
}
```

- Replace `YOUR_HF_TOKEN` with your (free-tier) Hugging Face token, if required.
- Some models allow inference without a token, but might be rate-limited.

### **Step 3: UI Integration**

- Add a button to your rich-text input: “Make clearer”
- On click, send the current text to the API and update the input with the improved text.

---

## 3. **Security & Limitations**

- **API keys:** Never expose sensitive API keys in frontend code. Some endpoints allow anonymous use or have test/demo keys.
- **Rate limits:** Free tiers are usually rate-limited—good for prototypes or personal projects.
- **Privacy:** User text is sent to a third party; notify users if you handle sensitive data.

---

## 4. **Other Ideas for AI Features**

- **Summarize CV:** Let users enter long CV texts and get a concise summary.
- **Rewrite for clarity:** Button to paraphrase/clarify input.
- **AI-powered suggestions:** Help users improve their job descriptions or achievements.
- **Auto-formatting:** Grammar and spelling checks.

---

## 5. **Example Button Implementation (Vue/React/Pure JS)**

If you want a snippet for your codebase (Vue, React, plain JS), just ask!

---

## **Summary**

- You can integrate AI by calling third-party APIs from your frontend.
- Hugging Face, OpenRouter, Replicate, DeepInfra, Gemini all offer free tiers or free models.
- Implement a button that sends the user’s text, gets the improved version, and updates the input.
- Be aware of rate limits, privacy, and API key security.
- No backend required!
