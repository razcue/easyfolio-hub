# EasyFolio Hub

## What is EasyFolio Hub?
EasyFolio Hub makes it simple for anyone to create a stunning, personalized portfolio or CV website—no technical know-how required. Just fill out a straightforward form with your information, and EasyFolio Hub takes care of the rest, instantly generating your professional site using the same high-quality components found in [EasyFolio Template](https://github.com/razcue/easyfolio-template).

EasyFolio Hub is designed as a zero-cost infrastructure, source-available, and community-driven platform; built with a mobile-first, fully responsive design, ensuring a great experience across all devices. All features run on free and open-source tools, with Vercel for hosting and GitHub as the data layer. The platform requires no custom backend or proprietary APIs: all logic, storage, and authentication are handled by GitHub Actions and the GitHub API. Authentication secrets are stored in a private GitHub repository—not on third-party servers.
